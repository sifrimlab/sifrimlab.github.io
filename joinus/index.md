## Postdocs

Email Alejandro a current CV with research background and publications list and a 1-2 page research statement with the specific areas you want to work on, how they fit with our group, and how they build upon your previous work.
Ask for 3 recommendation letters from your previous research supervisors and collaborators to be sent directly to Alejandro.

## Ph.D. applicants 

We are always on the lookout for brilliant and motivated bioinformaticians, if you are interested in applying for a Ph.D. at the LMIB, email Alejandro with your research background and a 1-2 letter motivation with the specific areas you want to work on, how they fit with our group, and how they build upon your previous work.

## Master students
If you are already admitted to KU Leuven, you should contact Alejandro Sifrim directly and set up a meeting to talk research. A strong background in algorithms or machine learning is a big plus, and some background in biology is encouraged though not required.
