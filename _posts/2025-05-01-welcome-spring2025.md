Welcoming our Newest PhD Student Vasiliki!
<!-- excerpt end -->

We are excited to welcome our newest PhD student, Vasiliki, to the LMIB team!
Vasiliki will collaborate with fellow PhD student Fatemeh to advance our understanding of congenital heart disease (CHD), a leading cause of non-infectious child mortality. Under the joint supervision of Alejandro and [Jeroen Breckpot](https://www.uzleuven.be/en/physicians-and-specialists/jeroen-breckpot) from UZ Leuven, she will use long-read whole genome sequencing to identify gene-phenotype associations and to better characterize complex genetic variation in CHD.
Her work will be part of the DeepHeart Project, a multi-laboratory initiative dedicated to identifying specific genes involved in non-syndromic congenital heart disease (NS-CHD).
