<!-- excerpt end -->

We are thrilled to welcome Anis and Lorenzo, our incoming PhD students, and Jelle, our new research associate, to the LMIB team! Anis will extend his previous thesis work in Explainable AI and apply it to multi-omic integration models along other models developed at the lab, and Lorenzo will propose new techniques to improve our current implementation of multi-omics integration models. 
Jelleâ€™s extensive experience as a researcher will help bring new perspectives and push the boundaries of our research even further. We are looking forward to the exciting research and collaboration ahead with such a talented and diverse group!
