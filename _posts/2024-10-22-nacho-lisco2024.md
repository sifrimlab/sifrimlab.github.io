Congratulations to our colleague Nacho for winning the Best Presentation Award at this year’s [LISCO Single Cell Day 2024](https://lisco.kuleuven.be/single-cell-day-2024). His presentation on **AI-based spatial multi-omic data fusion** was recognized for its innovation and engaging delivery. 

In his presentation, Nacho introduced an AI-driven approach to learning data representations that capture both shared and modality-specific variability across different omics layers. This method enhances our understanding of the complex interactions between these layers by disentangling shared variations from sample-specific biases and enabling cross-modal translation when one data modality is absent. He demonstrated the power of this neural network architecture using a prostate cancer dataset, showcasing how spatial multi-omics data, combined with cutting-edge AI techniques, can accurately predict detailed pathologist annotations.

We are proud to have an inspiring researcher pushing the boundaries of multi-omic integration in our lab, and this achievement is well deserved.

Here’s to many more successes ahead!
