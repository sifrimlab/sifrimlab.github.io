We are thrilled to share that our colleague Marios has been awarded a PhD fellowship from the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)!

This fellowship will support his doctoral research in our lab, where he will focus on leveraging multi-omic long-read sequencing data and deep learning to unravel the genetic dysregulation underlying complex sarcomas.

A huge congratulations to Marios for this outstanding achievement, weâ€™re proud and excited to see his research take off!
