Welcoming our Newest PhD Student Fatemeh, and Data Engineer Saptarshi!
<!-- excerpt end -->

We are thrilled to welcome our newest PhD student Fatemeh and our new data engineer Saptarshi to the LMIB team! 
Fatemeh will work on advancing our understanding of congenital heart disease (CHD), a leading cause of non-infectious child mortality by developing novel deep learning-based computational methods to prioritize candidate genes. With the DeepHeart Project, she aims to identify specific genes that are likely involved in non-syndromic congenital heart disease (NS-CHD). 

Saptarshi will design and implement scalable data architecture to efficiently manage LISCO's high-throughput single-cell and spatial omics data. He will oversee workflows from raw data generation in wet labs to AI model training and deployment by computational teams, ensuring models are continually updated to maintain accuracy and keep LISCO at the forefront of the field.
