I love solving the puzzles of genetics by developing new technologies and AI models to uncover innovative solutions, that's why I joined the lab to contribute to the DeepHeart project. I hold a master's degree from the Erasmus Mundus Biopham program, which took me to the Polytechnic University of Catalonia in Spain, the University of Lille and the Institute of Biology Paris Seine (IBPS) in France, the Mannheim Institute for Intelligent Systems in Medicine (MIISM) in Germany, and both the University of Pisa and École Normale Supérieure in Pisa, Italy. Across these institutions, I focused on the computational track.
Outside of the lab, I’m a book lover and watercolor painter. Running, learning new languages, and traveling are some of my favorite activities. Collaborative environments are my favorite, and I look forward to discussing our projects and offering ideas.
