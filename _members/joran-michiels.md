Joran obtained his bachelor’s degree at KU Leuven and a master’s degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology at ETH Zurich. He pursued his PhD in the [research group of Maarten De Vos](https://biomed-kuleuven.web.app/) at KU Leuven (ESAT–STADIUS), where he advanced local post-hoc explanation methods such as SHAP. His work focused on developing techniques that better account for feature dependencies, improving the interpretability of AI models, and on making explanations more actionable by enabling their correction to guide model training. His current research interests center on explainable AI that can capture complex feature interactions and provide meaningful, practically useful insights, with particular relevance to multi-omics.
