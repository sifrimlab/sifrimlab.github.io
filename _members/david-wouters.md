David is a PhD researcher in the lab. In his master thesis he wrote our in-house spatial-transcriptomics processing pipeline that takes the raw imaging data, and turns it into data formats that can be used for downstream analysis. During his PhD project, he uses his image-processing background to build a model that detects sub-cellular expression patterns in spatial-transcriptomics data using deep neural networks. Tangentially to that, he helps our collaborators within and outside the university with their image-based data analysis. Outside of work, he passes time by playing baseball, going to concerts, or fiddling with strangely personalized Linux-configuration.
