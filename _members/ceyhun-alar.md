Ceyhun is a PhD student in the Laboratory of Multi-omic Integrative Bioinformatics under Alejandro Sifrim. His path in science began with a master’s in Biomedical Sciences, where he first explored bioinformatics through his thesis under supervision of Alejandro where he developed a pipeline for the creation of inhouse probe panels for targeted spatial transcriptomic methods. In his PhD, Ceyhun is blending AI with multi-omic approaches to develop methods for choosing the right gene panels for spatial transcriptomic experiments. This work is crucial for understanding how cells are arranged and interact in different environments. 
Outside the lab, Ceyhun's passion for competition comes alive. Wherever there's a team and a score to keep, you'll find Ceyhun right in the mix, thriving on collaboration and pushing his team. His love for teamwork and competition shines, whether he's captaining on the football pitch, coordinating in a karting race, rallying with partners in padel, or strategizing in esports. He’s all about making sure the team has the best opportunity to perform. His commitment to giving his all in these competitive arenas mirrors the dedication he brings to his research.
