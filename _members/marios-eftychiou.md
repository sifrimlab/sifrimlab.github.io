Meet Marios, a PhD student shared between Laboratory of Multi-Omic Integrative Bioinformatics (LMIB) and the Laboratory of Integrative Cancer Genomics (LIG). Armed with a BSc in Biological Sciences from the University of Cyprus and an MSc in Statistics and Data Science from KU Leuven, Marios is on a mission. His research focuses on developing Deep Neural Network architectures to predict chromatin accessibility using long-read sequencing data and try to unravel the impact of genetic variation on chromatin accessibility, particularly in the context of cancer. When he's not decoding the mysteries of cancer genomics, you'll find him sculpting his physique at the gym or unwinding watching his favourite anime series.
