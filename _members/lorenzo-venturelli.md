I am a passionate Ph.D. student from Italy with an interest in applying Artificial Intelligence to biomedical challenges. In my doctoral studies, I am exploring cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence methodologies to extract meaningful information from multi-omics data, aiming to advance the field of Representational Learning with an emphasis on applications in cancer biology. Leveraging my background in computer engineering and AI theory, I hope to bring a fresh perspective and meaningful contributions to the lab's research.
