I’m a Ph.D. student from Italy, driven by a deep curiosity for how Artificial Intelligence can help us better understand biology. In my research, I’m working on ways to extract meaningful insights from multi-omics data, with a focus on cancer biology and representational learning. My background is in computer engineering and AI theory, but what excites me most is applying these tools to real biomedical problems. Outside the lab, I love to travel — not just to see new places, but to meet people and hear their stories. Connecting with others, whether through science or daily life, is something I value deeply.
