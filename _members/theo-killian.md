My research interests are focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms of ALS, cancer and aging, as well as integration of large scale multiomics data, reproducible research, bionanotechnology and synthetic biology. My hobbies include bike touring, climbing volcanoes and raising carnivorous plants.
