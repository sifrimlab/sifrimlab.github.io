After defending his master thesis in the lab and getting funding from the FWO, Nacho started his PhD focused on developing deep learning tools for multimodal data integration. Specifically, he develops novel methods that leverage the complementary information in single-cell  and spatial multi-omics to push the SOTA methods for cell type/state characterization, tissue microarchitecture analysis and whole-slide classification. By doing this, he aims to contribute to the next generation of molecular digital pathology, leading to new insights into disease, drug discovery and improving current diagnostic and prognostic tools. In his free time you might find him making an attempt his life either jumping from planes or practicing martial arts.
