Hello, I am Nynke, an enthusiastic and dedicated M.Sc. Bioinformatics student currently pursuing my master's degree at KU Leuven. Since September 2023, my thesis research has been dedicated to developing formal methodologies for evaluating the clustering of subcellular expression patterns. Drawing from a diverse skill set, I've cultivated my academic foundation through interdisciplinary studies in Technology and Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Twente, as well as a research master's program in Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience at Maastricht. Beyond academia, I actively contribute to student life, having fulfilled roles as a dedicated Class Representative and held leadership positions in student associations aimed at community engagement and organizational improvement. When not immersed in academic pursuits, I find joy in various creative outlets, including designing clothing, playing the piano, and the exploration of global cuisines through cooking.
