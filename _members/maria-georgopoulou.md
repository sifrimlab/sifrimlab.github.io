During my Ph.D, I use Single-nuclei Sequencing and Spatial Transcriptomics to study the Oligodendrocyte Dysfunction in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). My Ph.D. focuses in the analysis and interpretation of transcriptomic data, but also the validation of these data through immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent stainings, ELISAs and other RNA and protein detection techniques. 
The purpose of my project is to find possible gene, RNA, and protein markers that could be used for the diagnosis and therapy of ALS.
