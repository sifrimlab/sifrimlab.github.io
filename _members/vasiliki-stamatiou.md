After completing my Masterâ€™s in Molecular Life Sciences at Wageningen University in The Netherlands, I joined KU Leuven and the Laboratory of Multi-omic Integrative Bioinformatics to pursue my PhD under the supervision of Jeroen Breckpot and Alejandro Sifrim. As part of the DeepHeartNet project, my research focuses on understanding the genetic architecture of non-syndromic congenital heart disease (NS-CHD), using long-read whole genome sequencing to identify gene-phenotype associations and better capture complex genetic variation. In addition, I contribute to integrating genomic data with broader biological insights to help prioritize candidate genes for further investigation. Since this is active research, the specific techniques may evolve, but the overall aim is to improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind heart development and disease.

I enjoy working in international research environments, where diverse perspectives and collaboration drive discovery. Outside the lab, I love exploring new places, traveling often, spending time with friends in long conversations about anything and everything, and reading books in parks.
