Civil engineer captivated by one of the tiniest yet incredibly intricate and versatile "factories" of them all: living cells. Intrigued by how all information required for an organism's growth and homeostasis is encoded within its DNA and fascinated by how the brain operates.

Throughout my academic journey, Iâ€™ve combined genetics and high throughput molecular biology with computational analysis to further unravel the DNA and gene regulatory code, identifying a novel pioneer transcription factor and revealing regulatory compatibilities between transcriptional repressors and activators.
