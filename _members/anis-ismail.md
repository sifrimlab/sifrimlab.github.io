Anis has completed his Master's degree in Bioinformatics at KU Leuven, having earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering with high distinction from the Lebanese American University. His thesis project, initiated at the LMIB in September 2023, involves the development of an evaluation framework for explaining the latent space representations of multi-modal Variational Autoencoders (mVAEs) applied to prostate cancer data. Anis is continuing his doctoral training at the LMIB and planning to extend his work on explainable AI in the context of multi-omics integration. Before embarking on his master's thesis, Anis actively contributed to the research and development of cutting-edge machine learning and software solutions. His contributions extended to notable organizations such as the Machine Learning for Science Organization as part of Google Summer of Code and Unicle, a leading Biomedical Data Science startup. In his free time, Anis enjoys experimenting with new baking recipes and immersing himself in the worlds of historical and fantastical books.
