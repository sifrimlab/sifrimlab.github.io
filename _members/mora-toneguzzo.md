I am a Master’s student in Bioinformatics, with a background in biotechnology and a strong curiosity about machine learning and how it can be applied to complex biomedical problems. My thesis focuses on building richer representations of cellular complexity and spatial organization within tissues. When I’m not studying or working on my thesis, I enjoy reading, watching movies and grabbing a coffee.
