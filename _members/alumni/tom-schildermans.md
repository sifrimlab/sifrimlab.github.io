I am a Biomedical Sciences student currently working on my Master's thesis, which involves analyzing subcellular RNA localization patterns using an AI-based method. After completing my Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Sciences, I considered pursuing a Master's in Bioinformatics at KU Leuven, sparked by a growing interest in the field during my studies. Instead, I chose to pursue a Master's in Biomedical Sciences, with a focus on bioinformatics, through internships and my thesis work.
