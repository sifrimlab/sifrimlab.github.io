<p>Congratulations to our talented colleague Nacho for winning the Best Presentation Award at this year’s <a href="https://lisco.kuleuven.be/single-cell-day-2024">LISCO Single Cell Day 2024</a>. His presentation on <strong>AI-based spatial multi-omic data fusion</strong> was recognized for its innovation, clarity, and engaging delivery.</p>

<p>In his presentation, Nacho introduced an AI-driven approach to learning data representations that capture both shared and modality-specific variability across different omics layers. This method enhances our understanding of the complex interactions between these layers by disentangling shared variations from sample-specific biases and enabling cross-modal translation when one data modality is absent. He demonstrated the power of this neural network architecture using a prostate cancer dataset, showcasing how spatial multi-omics data, combined with cutting-edge AI techniques, can accurately predict detailed pathologist annotations.</p>

<p>This recognition is a testament to his dedication for pushing the boundaries of multi-omic integration and spatial transcriptomics. We are proud to have such an inspiring researcher in our lab, and this achievement is well deserved.</p>

<p>Here’s to many more successes ahead!</p>
