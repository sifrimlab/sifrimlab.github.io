## Spatial multi-omics
A human body comprises approximately 100 trillion cells. As most of our organ functions are executed by the concerted action of those individual cells in a spatially organised context, it is paramount to research these individual cells in their native spatial context. This is not only important to understand normal organ development and function, but also to investigate how cells are perturbed in diseased conditions. Technological developments in the last few years allow us to assay the expression of hundreds to thousands of genes at single-cell resolution while retaining the complete morphological and spatial information.

At LMIB, we are at the fore-front of the development of these technologies by working together with technologists and biologists, as part of the Leuven Single-Cell Institute, to create the next generation of spatial multi-omic technologies. We aim to develop novel data fusion strategies which integrate information gained from conventional microscopy with sub-cellular resolution multi-omics information by leveraging state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures.

## Variant Prioritization 
Genome sequencing studies reveal thousands to millions of genetic variants in any typical individual. These genetic variants are often benign, but a small subset can give rise to disease. However, the fundamental challenge of distinguishing between neutral and pathogenic variants is often non-trivial, and follow-up investigation of variants is often time and cost-prohibitive. Therefore, variant prioritization tools are needed which rank the most likely candidates based on available information on the nature of the respective variants, the genes wherein they reside, the tissues wherein these genes are expressed and the patientâ€™s phenotypic presentation.

At LMIB we aim to develop variant prioritization tools leveraging the latest publicly available data and state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and apply these tools in large-scale genetic studies in order to further understand the genetic etiology of human diseases and to provide improved genetic diagnostic outputs for patients.
